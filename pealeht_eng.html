                        My name is Regina Kuznetsova aka reginatattoos aka derpff. I’m from Estonia and currently I am 19 years old. I've been drawing and doing other art activities all my life and it's one of the most important things to me. My first sketchbook was made already in kindergarten. I started going to a private tutor at the age of 9, from whom I got the basics of drawing and painting. In addition, I have also studied at the Tartu Children's Art School, which I entered at the age of 11 and graduated with honors in 2019.

                        Art is my life. I paint, draw, do digital art, street art, clothing design, tattooing, and also room design. I believe that art is surrounded us. It's not part of my life, art is my life. I get inspiration from everywhere: movies, real-life situations, books, and also philosophy. I think philosophizing is an important part of being an artist. Each piece has multiple levels!
